# instagram-reels-clone
This is a simple front-end clone for the new feature of instagram: instagram reels.
It uses:
1.  ReactJS
2.  Material-UI
3.  Firebase (for database)

Note: Although, this is connected to database, video links are not updated in cloud firestore since, youtube video couldn't be fetched that way. If you want to use it, just update the links as per your choice and it will reflect on screen. The integration to firebase is functional.
